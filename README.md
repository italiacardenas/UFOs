# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to create and build a dynamic HTML page that allows "UFOlogists" to interact with the page. The interactivity involves inputting up to seven attributes that will create a filter for UFO citings within the inputted data. This allows the user to quickly grab the specific information they are searching for, such as date, location and even shape! 


## Results:
<b> The webpage is relatively easy to navigate. At first glance, it can be overwhleming because the website shows the entire database. </b>

<b> Once filtered the site feels less overwhelming. </b>

## Summary:

One of the biggest drawbacks, is that the user must be very specific of what they are searching for. To improve, there are two recommendations (and possibly more!) to be made. The first would be to create drop down lists for each filter, the second is to have ranges of dates rather than trying to find for a specific date.
