# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to create and build a dynamic HTML page that allows "UFOlogists" to interact with the page. The interactivity involves inputting up to seven attributes that will create a filter for UFO citings within the inputted data. This allows the user to quickly grab the specific information they are searching for, such as date, location and even shape! 


## Results:
The webpage is relatively easy to navigate. At first glance, it can be overwhleming because the website shows the entire database.
